# EvoLimerPic

Using github actions to automate generating images related to limericks.

## Qualities of an image
I need to define qualities of an image that can make up the "genetics" of an image.

Stuff like lines (horizontal, vertical, etc.), colours, brightness, contrast, shape related things.

Perhaps create the image by composing shapes with various transformations applied.
