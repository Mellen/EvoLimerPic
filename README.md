# EvoLimerPic

Using github actions to automate generating images related to limericks.

## "Genetics" of an image
I'll use the jpeg idea of the 2D discrete cosine transformations of the luminance, red crominance, and blue crominance.

Set the images to be 1024*1024, so the genetic sequence is three lots of 16 DCT basis functions.
